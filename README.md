# Hardware-Trojan-Detection-Using-Delay-Based-Method-on-FPGA
This project aimed to detect hardware Trojans in FPGA designs by measuring
delays on a single example path and its trojan-added versions. The method proved to
be effective by showing a significant difference in delay between the clean path and
the trojan path. Additionally, the project aimed to investigate the impact of in-chip
variations on delay measurements by placing multiple copies of the same design on
different parts of the chip. The results showed variations in delay, but the cause of these
variations is uncertain and further investigation is needed. The project concludes with
recommendations for future studies to improve the method and to test it on different
FPGA boards.
